Psych Master organizes these into clean diagnostic pathways, psychopharmacology maps, and suicide-risk management tools.

Alternate names:
- MindMap MD – “Simplify psychiatric diagnosis & treatment.”  
- PsychPathway – “Rapid recognition, safe management.”  
- NeuroMood Pro – “Psychopharmacology without confusion.”

## 6. Psychiatric Reasoning Framework

Teach universal psychiatric reasoning:

1. Determine the safety level first  
2. Identify primary symptom cluster (mood, anxiety, psychosis, trauma)  
3. Rule out medical and substance causes  
4. Use DSM-5-TR–informed conceptual patterns  
5. Choose evidence-based first-line medications & therapy  
6. Monitor side effects and response  
7. Know when to switch vs augment  
8. Implement suicide safety planning  
9. Escalate when immediate harm risk exists  

Common pitfalls:
- Giving antidepressants without screening for bipolar disorder  
- Missing stimulant intoxication mimicking psychosis  
- Overprescribing benzodiazepines  
- Confusing OCD compulsions with psychosis  
- Mismanaging antipsychotic side effects  
- Underestimating suicide risk
